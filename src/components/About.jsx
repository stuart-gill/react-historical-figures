      <h2>About Stuart</h2>
      <p>
        Carpenter and construction manager turned developer. My continual drive
        to gain knowledge and experience, eagerness to take on challenges, and
        desire and ability to create a positive work environment has served me
        well for 12 years in construction, and I'm excited to be bringing these
        same values to a new field. I've been learning full stack development at
        Epicodus in Seattle, and I love the struggle to learn and grow. My
        biggest interest is in logic and algorithm problems, and I truly enjoy
        collaborating with others to come up with creative solutions.
